**Certificate Signing Request Issue in an RKE cluster hosted on a cloud provider**

Sometimes, even though the certificate signing request (CSR) is approved by the certificate controller, the certificate is not shown in the status. This topic explains how to troubleshoot this issue in a Rancher managed Kubernetes cluster.

- Environment: Kubernetes cluster created by RKE in a cloud provider.

- Issue: Controller approved the Kubernetes certificate signing request, but the certificate is not shown as "Issued" in the status.

    **Expected Behaviour**:
    ```
     kubectl get csr -n citrix-cpx-istio-sidecar-injector

     NAME      AGE   SIGNERNAME   REQUESTOR   CONDITION

    cpx-sidecar-injector.citrix-system   51s   kubernetes.io/legacy-unknown   system:serviceaccount:citrix-cpx-istio-sidecar-injector:cpx-sidecar-injector-service-account   Approved, Issued
  ```
    
    **Outcome in RKE based Cluster**:
    
        kubectl get csr -n citrix-cpx-istio-sidecar-injector

        NAME   AGE   SIGNERNAME   REQUESTOR   CONDITION

        cpx-sidecar-injector.citrix-system   51s   kubernetes.io/legacy-unknown   system:serviceaccount:citrix-cpx-istio-sidecar-injector:cpx-sidecar-injector-service-account   Approved

Following is a workaround suggested in the Kubernetes documentation to resolve the issue:

1.	Enable the Kubernetes controller managerâ€™s default certificate [signer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/#a-note-to-cluster-administrators) using the following steps.
    1.	Edit your cluster in Rancher.
    2.	Click the Edit as YAML button and edit as the following (See the [Rancher cluster configuration](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/editing-clusters/) for information to edit the YAML file).
    ```
 	   services:
     kube-controller: 
       extra_args: 
        cluster-signing-cert-file: "/etc/kubernetes/ssl/kube-ca.pem"
        cluster-signing-key-file: "/etc/kubernetes/ssl/kube-ca-key.pem"
 	```
